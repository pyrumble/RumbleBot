# <img src="bot/img/http.png" alt="logo" width="30"/> RumbleBot 

An advanced discord music bot written in Python

I decided to release the source code of the bot, since i won't maintain anymore.

Now it's open source!

## How to setup the bot?

Clone this repository `git clone https://www.github.com/pyrumble/RumbleBot`

You should generate a file called config.yml based on [this example](/config-example.yml).

The configuration file must be in the root folder (where main.py is located).

You should create a python environment using `python3 -m venv env` and install the necessary dependencies.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

And then you just have to run the main.py and enjoy the bot! (If you set it up correctly, of course)

 > WARNING: It is likely that it won't work as it should, since this project was personal and I didn't think to release the code for anyone to use.. You must fix it on your own or writing your own discord bot, maybe...
